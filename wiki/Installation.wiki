== What do I need? ==
The rxDeveloper is tested with *Ubuntu 11.04* and *Linux Mint 11* and requires *ROS Electric* or newer, because of changes in the dependency-handling for tinyxml and yaml-cpp. For *ROS Diamondback* some changes are needed, but a diamondback version is available, too. To get the sourcecode you also need *subversion*.

== How do I get it running? ROS Electric ==
  * download the sourcecode: "svn checkout http://rxdeveloper-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ rxdeveloper-ros-pkg-read-only"
  * make sure that you did the ROS environment setup and "rxdeveloper-ros-pkg-read-only" is in the _ROS_PACKAGE_PATH_.
  * compile: "rosmake rxDev" (if you get errors during compilation, an update of tinyxml to version 2.6x will help)  
  * run: "rosrun rxDev rxdev" or start the binary "/rxDev/bin/rxdev"

== How do I get it running? ROS Diamondback & TinyXML 2.5.x ==
  * download the sourcecode: "svn checkout http://rxdeveloper-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/tags/rxDev-diamond rxDev"
  * make sure that you did the ROS environment setup and "rxdeveloper-ros-pkg-read-only" is in the _ROS_PACKAGE_PATH_.
  * compile: "rosmake rxDev"
  * run: "rosrun rxDev rxdev" or start the binary "/rxDev/bin/rxdev"
