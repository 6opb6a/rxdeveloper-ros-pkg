== specificationfiles ==
Specificationfiles are YAML-files for nodes, nodelets or dynamic reconfigure nodes containing information about the type, the package, publications, subscriptions, services and parameters.
These files are very usefull but not mandatory. You can use the rxDeveloper without specificationfiles, but it is more comfortable with them.

=== where are they used ===
rxDeveloper uses specification files to support the user in many ways:
  # If you want to remap topics, a list of possible topics shows up
    * remap arrows are automatically created when loading a launchfile
  # If you add a private parameter to a node, a list of possible parameters shows up (with default values)
    * the valus for parameters with ranges get checked for out-of-range problems
